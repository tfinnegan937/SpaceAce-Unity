# SpaceAce-Unity

This is a Unity project created for Computer Science 381 -- Game Engine Architecture at the University of Nevada, Reno.

SpaceAce is a standard 2.5D side-scrolling shoot-em-up designed for the purpose of learning the internal functions of
game engines. While SpaceAce uses Unity, the code structure of the game follows several Engine Architecture Paradigns,
such as modularity, polymorphism, the use of a complex system of managers, and a Finite State Machine system for AI.

The game has one full complete level, and a difficult boss fight with a complex attack pattern.
